    Description
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example
Example 1:

Input:

array = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
target = 1
Output:

2
Explanation:

1 is indexed at 2 in the array.

Example 2:

Input:

array = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
target = 0
Output:

-1
Explanation:

0 is not in the array. Returns -1.

Challenge
O(logN) time
    @param A: an integer rotated sorted array
    @param target: an integer to be searched
    @return: an integer

    def search(self, A, target):
